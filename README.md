Testing for final project. (This probably won't end up being the final product repository, just a sandbox.)

* 11/16/2019:
  * Created "project", following along with [this video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXLQ6C3qJvg).
  * Need to get to work on adding scripts: see video
* 11/17/2019:
  * Got horizontal movement and jumping to work. Values can be tweaked more to get exactly the feel we want.
  * Added world-switching functionality: press Z. There's not much to see here, and it still needs a lot of work, but the idea is there.
    * the key concept here is the collision matrix, in Edit -> Project Settings -> Physics 2D
